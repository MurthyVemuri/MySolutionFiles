      Think Java is an introduction to Java programming for beginners. 
It is tailored for students preparing for the Computer Science Advanced 
Placement (AP) Exam, but it is for anyone who wants to learn Java.<br><br>Think
 Java is concise. It uses a subset of Java that lets students work on 
interesting projects without getting bogged down in the details of Java.
      <br><br>Think Java teaches program development and debugging; 
these topics are discussed throughout the book and summarized in two 
appendices.<br><br>Think Java incorporates the GridWorld case study that
 is part of the AP Exam. The book provides the background you need to 
get started with the case study, and some additional exercises for 
practice.<br><br>Think Java is based on the original text of How to 
Think Like a Computer Scientist, a popular online textbook with versions
 in Python, C++ and OCaml, and translations into Spanish, French and 
other languages.
